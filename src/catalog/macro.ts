  summary: `PREMIUM TOOL — Requires API Advanced, Enterprise Startup, Enterprise Startup + Kafka, or Enterprise tier. Contact dev@unusualwhales.com to upgrade.

Long-running global commodity prices and US economic indicator time-series. Use this for macro context — "where is oil right now", "is CPI accelerating", "10y treasury yield trend", "what's the fed funds rate history" — or for backtests that need to overlay equity moves against the macro backdrop.

Available commands:
- commodity: Price series for a single commodity. Names: wti, brent, natural-gas, copper, aluminum, wheat, corn, cotton, sugar, coffee, all-commodities. Optional interval (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/annual; default monthly). Returns name, unit (e.g. "dollars per barrel"), and an array of {date, value}.
- economy: US economic indicator series. Indicators: gdp, gdp-per-capita, treasury-yield, fed-funds, cpi, inflation, retail-sales, durables, unemployment, payrolls. Optional interval (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/annual/semiannual). For treasury-yield, also pass maturity (3month, 2year, 5year, 7year, 10year, 30year). Returns the same {name, unit, data:[{date, value}]} shape.`,
