1. Get recent analyst ratings (upgrades, downgrades, initiations)${ticker ? ` for ${ticker}` : ""}
2. For each rating change, check:
   - Options flow before and after the rating
   - Whether flow preceded the rating (potential front-running)
   - Price reaction to the rating
3. Look for unusual options activity in names with upcoming expected ratings
4. Screen for analyst consensus changes

Provide:
- Recent analyst actions with price targets
- Flow correlation (did smart money know before the rating?)
- Stocks with options activity that might precede ratings
- Overall analyst sentiment trends
- Actionable ideas from analyst/flow alignment`
